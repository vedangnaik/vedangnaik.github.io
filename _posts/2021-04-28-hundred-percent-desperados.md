title: "On Techniques for Efficient 100% Steam Achievements in Desperados III"
---

I've been replaying [Desperados III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/610370/Desperados_III/) on PC recently. As I was going through the first few missions, I thought *Gee, it sure would be fun to do all these extra badges and maybe even 100% this game!* However, the badges for each level do not show up until after the first completion, which leads to a ton of wasted time. One also ends up missing a lot of the secret achievements in each level. Thus, I decided to create this 'roadmap' of sorts to allow one to 100% this game in as little time as possible.

<h3 style="color:red"> CAUTION! This roadmap contains a lot of spoilers for the main game. </h3>
<br>
<br>

With that in mind, let's begin. As of the writing of this post, the base game on Steam has 36 achievements. Many of them are 'quantity' achievements (i.e. *hide `x` bodies, mind control `y` guards*, etc.) which are naturally completed over the course of a playthrough. These are mentioned below:

| **Name** | **Completion Criterion** |
| They Wear Red Bandanas | Kill 75 Long Coats. |
| Maneater Shrub | Hide 750 bodies. |
| Someone Call the Undertaker | Kill 1,000 guards. |
| Watch Out Below! | Kill 50 guards using the environment. |
| Out of Sight, Out of Mind | Hide 250 bodies. |
| Another One Bites the Dust | Kill 500 guards. |
| Damn Good Marksman | Snipe 50 guards with McCoy. |
| Puppet Master | Mind control 25 guards with Isabelle. |
| Good Girl | Kill 75 guards with Bianca. |
| Doubletime | Kill 200 guards using Cooper's double shot. |
| Follow Me Darling | Make guards follow Kate for 1,000 meters total. | 

From here, I will mainly focus on the other achievements, proceeding in a mission-by-mission manner. Each mission section will focus on badges (for *Sheriff's Badge: Earn 90 badges.*), [the Mimimi dev NPCs](https://www.trueachievements.com/a298714/veteran-bounty-hunter-achievement) (for *Seasoned Bounty Hunter: Kill 15 of the hidden Mimimi devs.* and *Veteran Bounty Hunter: Kill 31 hidden Mimimi devs.*), and secret achievements.

| <u>Badges</u> | None |
| <u>Mimimi devs</u> | 0 |
| <u>Secret achievements</u>  | [*Lindberg and Hutch: Decide the outcome of a duel.*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esaBl_teFSI)
| <u>Notes</u> | This is probably the easiest mission to complete in Desperado difficulty, for the achievement *Hardcore: Finish a mission on "Desperado" difficulty.* |

| <u>Notes</u>  | This is a good mission to rack up double-shots for the quantity achievement *Doubletime*, if you're falling short. |
