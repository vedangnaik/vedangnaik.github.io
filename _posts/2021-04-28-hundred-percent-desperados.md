title: "On Techniques for Efficient 100% Steam Achievements in Desperados III"
---

I've been replaying [Desperados III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/610370/Desperados_III/) on PC recently. As I was going through the first few missions, I thought *Gee, it sure would be fun to do all these extra badges and maybe even 100% this game!* However, the badges for each level do not show up until after the first completion, which leads to a ton of wasted time. One also ends up missing a lot of the secret achievements in each level. Thus, I decided to create this 'roadmap' of sorts to allow one to 100% this game in as little time as possible.

<h3 style="color:red"> CAUTION! This post contains a lot of spoilers for the main game. </h3>
<br>
<br>

With that in mind, let's begin. As of the writing of this post, the base game on Steam has 36 achievements. Many of them are 'natural' achievements (i.e. *hide `x` bodies, mind control `y` guards*, etc.) which are naturally completed over the course of a playthrough. The remainder have to be specially pursued and obtained on a per-mission basis.

  <h4>Navigation</h4>
  * this unordered seed list will be replaced by toc as unordered list
  {:toc}
</nav>

## Natural Achievements

All the natural achievements are listed here. Some farming techniques have also been provided in case you're falling short. For all of these techniques, it suffices to create a quicksave just a second before the event, then reloading this over and over again until the desired number has been reached. For example, if farming for *Doubleshot*, use Showdown mode to make Cooper target two guards, then quicksave, then execute the action. After that, just reload the quicksave and execute it again over and over. Even though you're killing the same guards again and again, it still counts as separate kills in Steam achievements.

## Specific Achievements

This section will focus on the other achievements, proceeding in a mission-by-mission manner. Each mission section will focus on badges (for *Sheriff's Badge: Earn 90 badges.*), [the Mimimi dev NPCs](https://www.trueachievements.com/a298714/veteran-bounty-hunter-achievement) (for *Seasoned Bounty Hunter: Kill 15 of the hidden Mimimi devs.* and *Veteran Bounty Hunter: Kill 31 hidden Mimimi devs.*), and any secret achievements.

            <ol>
                <li><u>Don't use a disguises</u>: This isn't as hard as it may sound; you just have to be careful and use Kate's perfume cleverly.</li>
                <li><u>Take a photo of the dead groom</u>: <b>Important!</b> This is an easily-overlooked badge; you must pick up the Mayor's body and throw it down <i>before</i> you make Cooper and Kate jump off the balcony. Once they're down, there's no way to go back up there. Afterwards, it's fairly easy to carry his body to the camera and take the photo.</li>
                <li><u>With Cooper, enter the building through the main balcony door</u>: <b>Important!</b> This is another easy badge to lock yourself out of: In the Kate-only part, make sure to make her <i>unlock</i> the main balcony door before the cutscene. Otherwise, Cooper can't enter.</li>
                <li><u>Don't use the Gatling Gun</u>: You may as well use the disguise for this, since this and badge #5 cannot be completed simultaneously.</li>

                <li><u>Finish the mission without using a torch</u>: Note that even picking up a torch counts as 'using' it.</li>
                <li><u>Win the bet with Hector</u>: This cannot be done simultaneously with the badge #4.</li>
                <li><u>Win the bet with McCoy</u>: This cannot be done simultaneously with the badge #3.</li>
                <li><u>Burn 15 guards in oil puddles</u>: This can be 'manually' done by knocking out 15 guards and using Hector and McCoy to place them on an oil puddle, then lighting it on fire. Make sure to do one set of five to get the <i>Inferno</i> achievement. This method may conflict with badge #2, however.</li>

                <li>It may be possible to save time getting badges #3 and #4 by creating a save point before the end of the mission and them finishing it once with Hector and once with McCoy. I have not tested this however.</li>

                <li><u>Get the dynamite from the shooting range</u>: This badge cannot be completed simultaneously with badge #1</li>
                <li><u>Kill 3 guards with rolling logs</u>: The logs are near the sawmill near the shooting range. With her disguise, Kate can easily walk there and release the logs undetected.</li>
                <li><u>Kill 3 guards at the same time in a quarry explosion</u>: Self-explanatory. The explosion is instantaneous, so you can use Showdown mode to clear the remaining guards and run and detonate the dynamite to finish off the three near the wall.</li>
                <li><u>Kill 5 guards when destroying the bridge</u>: This can be 'manually' done by knocking out 5 guards and using the characters to move them to the centre of the bridge, right above where the dynamite is placed. This can be done at any time before shooting the dynamite. The badge will appear midway through the cut-scene.</li>

            <ol>
                <li><u>Return the money to the bank</u>: <b>Important!</b> This is an easy badge to lock yourself out of. At the very start of the mission, use Hector to knock out the woman outside the hut. She'll drop the money, which Hector can pick up. Drop this onto the floor of the bank in the same room where McCoy is being held to get the badge. If you wait until after you rescue McCoy, she will disappear and the badge will no longer be obtainable.</li>

                <li><u>Kill 6 guards</u>: You can throw guards into the water to kill them. You can also kill up to 3 guards using the cannon in the middle of the level.</li>
                <li><u>Don't use the bank's backdoor</u>: The 'back door' refers to the entrance from the construction area. Again, this is easier than it appears; see the <i>Notes</i> section for details.</li>
                <li><u>Make a guard follow your footprints for 50 meters</u>: This requires a bit of timing, but can be done immediately at the very beginning of the level. Lure the guard near the water tower. Use the incline the hut is on to break his line of sight, and keep circling around the cliff until the badge notification appears.</li>

This can be abused beyond belief in this level and makes Hector very overpowered; in fact, all 7 badges listed can be done in a <i>single</i> playthrough. This 'mechanic' is a by-product of the NPC AI, and has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QupN4qDG3Oc">acknowledged by the developers</a> as something which can be abused.</li>
                <li>I noticed that McCoy's bag had somehow dropped, despite McCoy himself not being conscious. I'm not sure if this is a bug or not.</li>

                <li><u>Don't touch water</u>: This badge is quite tedious, but is probably easier than the alternative <u>Don't use Isabelle's connect ability</u>, since Connect is so integral to Isabelle's playstyle. Note that this doesn't just mean you can't swim; a single <i>touch</i> of water invalidates this badge. Thus, keep checking the status regularly to make sure that no character accidentally walked through a puddle or something somewhere.</li>
                <li><u>Free Kate or Hector first</u>: Note that neither can be freed without the key; since McCoy isn't available, the lock cannot be picked.</li>
                <li><u>Kill 5 guards at the same time</u>: This is best done after you have Hector and Cooper, at the least. Hector's shotgun and Cooper's double-shot make this fairly easy.</li>
                <li><u>Kill 3 guards with an environment kill</u>: This is straightforward. At the very beginning, the mind-controlled guard can be used to kill the two guards under the pile of boxes. After that, there's a single guard under a big rock near Cooper's boat.</li>

                <li><b>Important!</b> This is a general tip for all levels with Isabelle. If a normal guard and a Long Coat are connected together, <i>killing or knocking out</i> the normal guard will cause the Long Coat to enter the stagger state, as if they'd been shot. This allows Isabelle to single-handedly take out Long Coats. This can be exploited further by bringing along one unconscious and tied-up guard and connecting to them.</li>
                <li>Note that Isabelle cannot move when she's mind-controlling someone. This means you must move her to a safe place before starting, otherwise you run the risk of another guard seeing her.</li>
                <li>Isabelle can use a mind-controlled guard to easily take over the Gatling gun near Cooper's boat and clear the area.</li>

                <li><u>Kill all suspects</u>: Again, fairly straightforward. It's best combined with badge #3. If doing so, make sure to save at least 2 mind-control darts for use with the dog.</li>
                <li><u>Kill 3 guards using dogs</u>: You must mind-control the dog and force it to bite a guard. You will need at least 2 darts for this. Make sure to use Isabelle to connect two guards together to get more bang for you bark 😉. Similar to mind-controlled guards, other enemies will not raise an alert upon seeing the dead bodies.</li>
                <li><u>Don't kill anyone</u>: This is a little tedious, but not overly difficult; see the <i>Notes</i> section. Make sure to switch all characters to their non-lethal mode by default to avoid mistaken kills.</li>
                <li><u>Get information on aliases and locations for all suspects - Gather the codenames and locations for all suspects</u>: This does not need to be done if going for badge #2.</li>

                <li><b>Important!</b> This is a general tip for all levels with Kate. Kate has an 'instantaneous' body pick up animation. This can be used to cancel the long falling animation of guards who have just been shot. For example, if a guard is standing in the grey viewcone of another guard, Kate can shoot him and them immediately pick them up to cancel the fall animation and prevent the other guard from noticing. This makes certain parts of this level much easier.</li>
                <li>Make sure to get Kate's disguise; it's very easy to obtain and her Lure ability can be heavily used in this level. Luring guards from guarded zones to civilian zones is especially useful since most actions such as knockouts and kills are ignored in civil zones. The pier section specifically can be almost completely cleared with disguised Kate alone.</li>
                <li>When wearing her disguise, Kate will not get caught even if she triggers environmental traps.</li>

            <ol>
                <li><u>Kill everyone except for civilians</u>: This badge is fairly straightforward. Make sure to not knock out, tie up, and throw guards into bushes; if they disappear, this badge will become unobtainable. Note that this badge also (apparently) includes the reinforcements that arrive after you set the boat on fire; use Hector's shotgun to deal with them the moment they exit the guard house.</li>
                <li><u>No knockouts or melee kills except for Isabelle</u>: This isn't as difficult as it sounds; you're still allowed to use Cooper's knife and guns, Hector's bear trap, and McCoy's sniper rifle. In fact, it's possible to forgo even his sniper rifle and combine this with badge #3.</li>
                <li><u>Don't use McCoy's snipe</u>: This includes using McCoy's sniper rifle to shoot environmental objects and to stun Long Coats.</li>

                <li><b>Important!</b> This is a general tip for all levels with Hector. Hector can use bodies to knock out your <i>other</i> characters, then pick them up and throw them over short obstacles.
