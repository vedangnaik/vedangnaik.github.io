title: "On Techniques for Efficient 100% Steam Achievements in Desperados III"
---

I've been replaying [Desperados III](https://store.steampowered.com/app/610370/Desperados_III/) on PC recently. As I was going through the first few missions, I thought *Gee, it sure would be fun to do all these extra badges and maybe even 100% this game!* However, the badges for each level do not show up until after the first completion, which leads to a ton of wasted time. One also ends up missing a lot of the secret achievements in each level. Thus, I decided to create this 'roadmap' of sorts to allow one to 100% this game in as little time as possible.

<h3 style="color:red"> CAUTION! This post contains a lot of spoilers for the main game. </h3>
<br>
<br>

With that in mind, let's begin. As of the writing of this post, the base game on Steam has 36 achievements. Many of them are 'quantity' achievements (i.e. *hide `x` bodies, mind control `y` guards*, etc.) which are naturally completed over the course of a playthrough. These are mentioned below:

| **Name** | **Completion Criterion** |
| They Wear Red Bandanas | Kill 75 Long Coats. |
| Maneater Shrub | Hide 750 bodies. |
| Someone Call the Undertaker | Kill 1,000 guards. |
| Watch Out Below! | Kill 50 guards using the environment. |
| Out of Sight, Out of Mind | Hide 250 bodies. |
| Another One Bites the Dust | Kill 500 guards. |
| Damn Good Marksman | Snipe 50 guards with McCoy. |
| Puppet Master | Mind control 25 guards with Isabelle. |
| Good Girl | Kill 75 guards with Bianca. |
| Doubletime | Kill 200 guards using Cooper's double shot. |
| Follow Me Darling | Make guards follow Kate for 1,000 meters total. | 

From here, I will mainly focus on the other achievements, proceeding in a mission-by-mission manner. Each mission section will focus on badges (for *Sheriff's Badge: Earn 90 badges.*), [the Mimimi dev NPCs](https://www.trueachievements.com/a298714/veteran-bounty-hunter-achievement) (for *Seasoned Bounty Hunter: Kill 15 of the hidden Mimimi devs.* and *Veteran Bounty Hunter: Kill 31 hidden Mimimi devs.*), and secret achievements.

                <li><u>Kill 3 bandits at the same time</u>: The <i>Kaboom</i> secret achievement will take care of this.</li>
                <li><u>Kill 10 bandits using dynamite</u>: This is straightforward: just make sure to leave enough guards alive for this.</li>
                <li><u>Distract 3 bandits at the same time using Cooper's coin</u>: In Hard mode, this can be done to the three bandits standing under the big rock.</li>
                <li><u>Don't use firearms</u>: This is a little tricky, but with some patience it can be done alongside all the other badges here.</li>

                <li><u>Bury Josh</u>: In the church area, there's a NPC named "Josh". After killing him, throw him into the open grave in the church courtyard to earn this.</li>

            <ol>
                <li><u>Don't use a disguises</u>: This isn't as hard as it may sound; you just have to be careful and use Kate's perfume cleverly.</li>
                <li><u>Take a photo of the dead groom</u>: <b>Important!</b> This is an easily-overlooked badge; you must pick up the Mayor's body and throw it down <i>before</i> you make Cooper and Kate jump off the balcony. Once they're down, there's no way to go back up there. Afterwards, it's fairly easy to carry his body to the camera and take the photo.</li>
                <li><u>With Cooper, enter the building through the main balcony door</u>: <b>Important!</b> This is another easy badge to lock yourself out of: In the Kate-only part, make sure to make her <i>unlock</i> the main balcony door before the cutscene. Otherwise, Cooper can't enter.</li>
                <li><u>Don't use the Gatling Gun</u>: Self-explanatory. You may as well use the disguise for this, since this and badge #5 cannot be completed simultaneously.</li>
                <li><u>Kill 15 guards with the Gatling Gun</u>: Self-explanatory.</li>
