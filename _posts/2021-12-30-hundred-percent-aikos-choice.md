[Aiko's Choice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579380/Shadow_Tactics_Aikos_Choice/), the long-awaited expansion to the hit game [Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun](https://store.steampowered.com/app/418240/Shadow_Tactics_Blades_of_the_Shogun/) launched a few weeks back. I finally had time to 100% it this winter break, and, in the spirit of my earlier roadmap for [Desperados III](https://vedangnaik.github.io/2021/04/28/hundred-percent-desperados/), decided to make another one for it. I hope you find it useful! 

<h3 style="color: red"> CAUTION! This post contains a lot of spoilers for the main game. </h3>

## Introduction
With that in mind, let's begin. First, some terminology:
* A 'mission' is a set of objectives which you characters achieve on a map. Examples include *Reunion at Nagoya, The Best Laid Plans*, etc. There are 6 missions (3 story, 3 interlude) in the main story. These have no specific formatting.
* ***Steam achievements*** (or just ***achievements***) are the main focus on this article.
* A <u>badge</u> is a specific challenge associated with a story mission.
* Hyperlinked [words like these](#) will link to external resources like YouTube videos or other guides. Some information is best conveyed through these means.
* Character `skills` are highlighted like this. Examples include Hayato's `Shuriken`, Aiko's `Disguise`, etc. These are not the full names as they appear in-game, but are clear enough regardless.

As of the writing of this post, the base game on Steam has 44 achievements. Some of these can be contributed to from any mission (e.g. ***Contestant: Kill or knock out 50 guards***) while others can only be done on certain missions (e.g. ***Vacation Time: Find the perfect spot for sunbathing***). This guide will go through the main story on a playthrough-by-playthrough basis mainly focussing on the latter, with an emphasis on 
* ***Badge Collector: Collect 17 badges***: Out of the 6 missions in the game, 3 have 9 badges each. This gives us a total of 27 badges, out of which we must earn 17. Not all of the badges are equally easy to earn however, so I have chosen what are, in my opinion, the easiest ones to get for each mission. Since all these missions have <u>Complete the mission on Hardcore difficulty.</u>, some playthroughs may be in Hardcore mode. A playthrough will be coloured <span class="normal-difficulty">like so</span> if the difficulty is 'Normal' and <span class="hard-difficulty">like so</span> if the difficulty is 'Hardcore'.

There will also be farming tips for some of the mission-agnostic achievements, if applicable. For these farming techniques, it suffices to create a quicksave just a second before the event, then reloading this over and over again until the desired number has been reached. For example, if farming for ***Multiple Personalities: Use Aiko's disguise 15 times.***, make a quicksave just before activating `Disguise` and reload the quicksave once the animation has finished. Even though it's the same disguise and in the same level, it will still count towards the achievement.

I've also included some general tips to aid you on your playthroughs.

## General Tips
In no particular order, here are some tips, mechanics, and notes that I've either noticed myself or learnt from speedruns and other sources.

## Main Story Missions

### Reunion at Nagoya
This mission has a lot of achievements. Also, 7 of its 9 badges can be completed in a single playthrough.

<h4 class="hard-difficulty">Playthrough #1</h4>

* Achieve ***(1/44) Three for Two for One: 3 times in one mission, kill 2 guards at once with Mugen's Swordwind***. There are plenty of two- and three-man groups in this level.
* Achieve ***(2/44) Deadly Acrobatics: Kill a guard with a drop attack from a rope***. There are multiple tightropes in this level from where you can kill a guard. There's no need to finish the mission; quicksave before doing it and then reload once the achievement pops up.
* Achieve ***(3/44) They Never Listen: Talk to a samurai when disguised with Aiko***. Place down a **manual save** before you do this, since it will invalidate one of the badges we are aiming for in this playthrough. Once you've done so, wear the disguise, then attempt to talk to a Samurai. This will obviously fail and the Samurai will attack Aiko, but you'll get the achievement for it. Reload your manual save to continue.
* Achieve ***(4/44) Fare Well: Throw a guard into a well***. You can do this right at the beginning of the mission with the guard in front of the well.
* Achieve ***(5/44) Reunion at Nagoya: Finish the mission “Reunion at Nagoya*** by finishing this playthrough.
* Achieve ***(6/44) Homeowner: Kill all enemies at the mansion in Nagoya***. It is unclear which guards exactly count as being 'in' the mansion. If you wish to be safe, you can kill everyone in the general area. The achievement will not unlock until you finish the playthrough.
* Achieve ***(7/44) Screen Wrap: Come out of the other side of the river in Nagoya***. This can be done by trying to swim off the north end of the river. You'll 'magically' pop out on the south end on the other side of the bridge. You can do this at any point: it pops up instantly.
* Earn <u>(1/17) Complete the mission on Hardcore difficulty.</u> by completing this playthrough.
* Earn <u>(2/17) Get the disguise at the estate</u>. You'll need to come here anyway to achieve ***Homeowner***.
* Earn <u>(3/17) Don't use Mugen's Sword Wind while in the safe house.</u>. Your characters may take a point or two of damage, but it's not a big deal. Don't worry about setting off an alert; it will not affect anything after the cutscene.
* Earn <u>(4/17) Don't kill anyone between exiting the safe house and regrouping on the roofs.</u>. This is slightly finnicky, but not very difficult. Make sure to switch your characters to non-lethal mode, and don't throw knocked-out guards into the water. They can however be thrown into barrels without 'killing' them, even though they never wake up and come out.
* Earn <u>(5/17) Don't use Mugen's sake</u> and <u>(6/17) Don't use a disguise</u>. This is not as hard as it sounds; make liberal use of Hayato's `Stone` and Aiko's `Perfume` to distract guards and sneak around. In addition, don't forget your characters' `Flintlocks`: they are very powerful, and you have quite a few shots between everybody.
* Earn <u>(7/17) Kill 5 enemies at the same time with Mugen's Sword Wind</u>. This can be done by piling up 5 unconscious guards in a safe location. Alternately, once you have reached the rendezvous point on the rooftop, you can kill the 5 guards standing outside the safehouse (although the Samurai will have to be weakened first with a `Flintlock`). You can quicksave-quickload this a few times to achieve ***(8/44) A Strong Blow: Kill 20 guards with Mugen's Swordwind***.

### A Night At Sea
The first interlude mission, this has very few achievements and no badges.

<h4 class="hard-difficulty">Playthrough #1</h4>

* Achieve ***(9/44) A Night at Sea: Finish the mission “A Night at Sea”*** by finishing this playthrough.
* Achieve ***(10/44) He Did Not Use His Leg: Kill at least 3 guards in the mission “A Night at Sea”*** by using Kuma to lure 3 guards under the crate on the second deck of the ship, then dropping it on them. You can quicksave-quickload this a few times to achieve ***(11/44) Environmentalist: Kill 30 guards with the help of the environment***.

<p class="navigation-link">[Back to Navigation](#navigation)</p><br>




### The Best Laid Plans
The second story mission. This mission has a lot of achievements, but some of them conflict with certain badges. Hence, manual saves will be used to play through the mission multiple times to achieve conflicting objectives with the minimum effort.

<h4 class="normal-difficulty">Playthrough #1</h4>

* Achieve ***(12/44) Sunflower Samurai: Kill a Samurai with a flower pot*** by dropping the flower pot on top of the Lighthouse onto the Samurai.
* Achieve ***(13/44) Vacation Time: Find the perfect spot for sunbathing*** by swimming to the small island in the middle of the map.
* Achieve ***(14/44) The Best Laid Plans: Finish the mission “The Best Laid Plans”*** by completing this playthrough.
* Achieve ***(15/44) Diver's Delight: Travel 1200 meters in water during the mission “The Best Laid Plans”*** by swimming around in the water. This should happen naturally as you play the level, but if it doesn't, just select all characters who can swim and move them from place to place for a bit.
* Earn <u>(8/17) Don't use Yuki's whistle</u>. This isn't as hard as it sounds; use the footprints-in-the-sand mechanic instead.
* Earn <u>(9/17) Kill 3 guards with exploding crates</u>. You can do this on the very first island by knocking out some guards and piling them up near the crate before setting it on fire.
* Earn <u>(10/17) On Shrine Island, destroy the crate without killing or knocking out enemies or raising the alarm</u>. This is a very finnicky badge, but is doable even on Hardcore mode. Make sure to quicksave often; you'll be barely skirting everybody's view cones.
* Earn <u>(11/17) Kill all samurai</u>. It is unclear whether shooting one with Takuma counts as 'killing'; to be on the safe side, you can use the characters' `Flintlocks` instead.
* Earn <u>(12/17) Don't kill or knock out the captain</u> by not doing so when rescuing Takuma.
* At this point, put down a **manual save**. Make sure to leave Tree Island (the one with the wisteria tree) alone before doing this. Complete the playthrough to earn <u>(13/17) Complete the mission on Hardcore difficulty</u>, as well as achieving ***(16/44) Sleepy Takuma: Don't kill anyone with Takuma during the mission “The Best Laid Plans”***.
* Reload your manual save. Then, achieve ***(17/44) Knife in the Back: Kill the Captain*** by killing the Straw Hat on the bridge of the ship.
* Earn <u>(14/17) On Tree Island, kill all enemies except the Samurai with Takuma, without raising the alarm</u>. Note that you can use your other characters to knock our guards for Takuma to shoot. They can also hide bodies to prevent the alarm from being raised.
* When killing the Samurai on Tree Island, quicksave-quickload using Yuki to deliver the killing blow to achieve ***(18/44) Little Giant: Kill 3 Samurai with Yuki***.

### Red Lights At Matsuyama
<!-- * If you have some folks left alive in range of Takuma at this point, you can use Shadow mode with all 5 characters to achieve ***(19/44) Planning Master: Kill or knock out 5 guards at the same time with all 5 characters*** and ***(20/44) Five Shadows: Execute a plan with all 5 characters***. You can quicksave-quickload this to farm for
    - ***(/44) Contestant: Kill or knock out 50 guards***
    - ***(/44) Genin: Kill or knock out 100 guards***
    - ***(/44) Shinobi: Kill or knock out 150 guards***
    - ***(/44) He Had to Use His Leg: Kill 10 guards with Takuma's Sniper Rifle that are farther than 25 meters away from him***
    - ***(/44) Methodical: Hide 50 bodies***
    - ***(/44) Elaborate: Hide 100 bodies***
    - ***(/44) Masterful: Hide 150 bodies*** -->
