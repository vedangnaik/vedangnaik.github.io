[Aiko's Choice](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1579380/Shadow_Tactics_Aikos_Choice/), the long-awaited expansion to the hit game [Shadow Tactics: Blades of the Shogun](https://store.steampowered.com/app/418240/Shadow_Tactics_Blades_of_the_Shogun/) launched a few weeks back. I finally had time to 100% it this winter break, and, in the spirit of my earlier roadmap for [Desperados III](https://vedangnaik.github.io/2021/04/28/hundred-percent-desperados/), decided to make another one for it. I hope you find it useful! 

<h3 style="color: red"> CAUTION! This post contains a lot of spoilers for the main game. </h3>

## Introduction
With that in mind, let's begin. First, some terminology:
* A 'mission' is a set of objectives which you characters achieve on a map. Examples include *Reunion at Nagoya, The Best Laid Plans*, etc. There are 6 missions (3 story, 3 interlude) in the main story. These have no specific formatting.
* ***Steam achievements*** (or just ***achievements***) are the main focus on this article.
* A <u>badge</u> is a specific challenge associated with a story mission.
* Hyperlinked [words like these](#) will link to external resources like YouTube videos or other guides. Some information is best conveyed through these means.
* Character `skills` are highlighted like this. Examples include Hayato's `Shuriken`, Aiko's `Disguise`, etc. These are not the full names as they appear in-game, but are clear enough regardless.

As of the writing of this post, the base game on Steam has 44 achievements. Some of these can be contributed to from any mission (e.g. ***Contestant: Kill or knock out 50 guards***) while others can only be done on certain missions (e.g. ***Vacation Time: Find the perfect spot for sunbathing***). This guide will go through the main story on a playthrough-by-playthrough basis mainly focussing on the latter, with an emphasis on 
* ***Badge Collector: Collect 17 badges***: Out of the 6 missions in the game, 3 have 9 badges each. This gives us a total of 27 badges, out of which we must earn 17. Not all of the badges are equally easy to earn however, so I have chosen what are, in my opinion, the easiest ones to get for each mission. Since all these missions have <u>Complete the mission on Hardcore difficulty.</u>, some playthroughs may be in Hardcore mode. A playthrough will be coloured <span class="normal-difficulty">like so</span> if the difficulty is 'Normal' and <span class="hard-difficulty">like so</span> if the difficulty is 'Hardcore'.

There are a number of farming achievements. To farm these, it suffices to create a quicksave just a second before the event, then reloading this over and over again until the desired number has been reached. For example, if farming for ***Multiple Personalities: Use Aiko's disguise 15 times***, make a quicksave just before activating `Disguise` and reload the quicksave once the animation has finished. Even though it's the same disguise and in the same level, it will still count towards the achievement.

## Main Story Missions

### Reunion at Nagoya
This mission has a lot of achievements. Also, 7 of its 9 badges can be completed in a single playthrough.

<h4 class="hard-difficulty">Playthrough #1</h4>

* Achieve ***(1/44) Three for Two for One: 3 times in one mission, kill 2 guards at once with Mugen's Sword Wind***. There are plenty of two- and three-man groups in this level.
* Achieve ***(2/44) Deadly Acrobatics: Kill a guard with a drop attack from a rope***. There are multiple tightropes in this level from where you can kill a guard. There's no need to finish the mission; quicksave before doing it and then reload once the achievement pops up.
* Achieve ***(3/44) They Never Listen: Talk to a samurai when disguised with Aiko***. Place down a **manual save** before you do this, since it will invalidate one of the badges we are aiming for in this playthrough. Once you've done so, wear the disguise, then attempt to talk to a Samurai. This will obviously fail and the Samurai will attack Aiko, but you'll get the achievement for it. Reload your manual save to continue.
* Achieve ***(4/44) Fare Well: Throw a guard into a well***. You can do this right at the beginning of the mission with the guard in front of the well.
* Achieve ***(5/44) Reunion at Nagoya: Finish the mission “Reunion at Nagoya*** by finishing this playthrough.
* Achieve ***(6/44) Homeowner: Kill all enemies at the mansion in Nagoya***. It is unclear which guards exactly count as being 'in' the mansion. If you wish to be safe, you can kill everyone in the general area. The achievement will not unlock until you finish the playthrough.
* Achieve ***(7/44) Screen Wrap: Come out of the other side of the river in Nagoya***. This can be done by trying to swim off the north end of the river. You'll 'magically' pop out on the south end on the other side of the bridge. You can do this at any point: it pops up instantly.
* Earn <u>(1/17) Complete the mission on Hardcore difficulty.</u> by completing this playthrough.
* Earn <u>(2/17) Get the disguise at the estate</u>. You'll need to come here anyway to achieve ***Homeowner***.
* Earn <u>(3/17) Don't use Mugen's Sword Wind while in the safe house.</u>. Your characters may take a point or two of damage, but it's not a big deal. Don't worry about setting off an alert; it will not affect anything after the cutscene.
* Earn <u>(4/17) Don't kill anyone between exiting the safe house and regrouping on the roofs.</u>. This is slightly finnicky, but not very difficult. Make sure to switch your characters to non-lethal mode, and don't throw knocked-out guards into the water. They can however be thrown into barrels without 'killing' them, even though they never wake up and come out.
* Earn <u>(5/17) Don't use Mugen's sake</u> and <u>(6/17) Don't use a disguise</u>. This is not as hard as it sounds; make liberal use of Hayato's `Stone` and Aiko's `Perfume` to distract guards and sneak around. In addition, don't forget your characters' `Flintlocks`: they are very powerful, and you have quite a few shots between everybody.
* Earn <u>(7/17) Kill 5 enemies at the same time with Mugen's Sword Wind</u>. This can be done by piling up 5 unconscious guards in a safe location. Alternately, once you have reached the rendezvous point on the rooftop, you can kill the 5 guards standing outside the safe house (although the Samurai will have to be weakened first with a `Flintlock`).

### A Night At Sea
The first interlude mission. It has very few achievements and no badges.

<h4 class="normal-difficulty">Playthrough #1</h4>

* Achieve ***(8/44) A Night at Sea: Finish the mission “A Night at Sea”*** by finishing this playthrough.
* Achieve ***(9/44) He Did Not Use His Leg: Kill at least 3 guards in the mission “A Night at Sea”*** by using Kuma to lure 3 guards under the crate on the second deck of the ship, then dropping it on them.

<p class="navigation-link">[Back to Navigation](#navigation)</p><br>




### The Best Laid Plans
The second story mission. This mission has a lot of achievements, but some of them conflict with certain badges. Hence, manual saves will be used to play through the mission multiple times to achieve conflicting objectives with the minimum effort.

<h4 class="hard-difficulty">Playthrough #1</h4>

* Achieve ***(10/44) Sunflower Samurai: Kill a Samurai with a flower pot*** by dropping the flower pot on top of the Lighthouse onto the Samurai.
* Achieve ***(11/44) Vacation Time: Find the perfect spot for sunbathing*** by swimming to the small island in the middle of the map.
* Achieve ***(12/44) Diver's Delight: Travel 1200 meters in water during the mission “The Best Laid Plans”*** by swimming around in the water. This should happen naturally as you play the level, but if it doesn't, just select all characters who can swim and move them from place to place for a bit.
* Earn <u>(8/17) Don't use Yuki's whistle</u>. This isn't as hard as it sounds; use the footprints-in-the-sand mechanic instead.
* Earn <u>(9/17) Kill 3 guards with exploding crates</u>. You can do this on the very first island by knocking out some guards and piling them up near the crate before setting it on fire.
* Earn <u>(10/17) On Shrine Island, destroy the crate without killing or knocking out enemies or raising the alarm</u>. This is a very finnicky badge, but is doable even on Hardcore mode. Make sure to quicksave often; you'll be barely skirting everybody's view cones.
* Earn <u>(11/17) Kill all samurai</u>. It is unclear whether shooting one with Takuma counts as 'killing'; to be on the safe side, you can use the characters' `Flintlocks` instead.
* Earn <u>(12/17) Don't kill or knock out the captain</u> by not doing so when rescuing Takuma.
* At this point, put down a **manual save**. Make sure to leave Tree Island (the one with the wisteria tree) alone before doing this. Complete the playthrough to earn <u>(13/17) Complete the mission on Hardcore difficulty</u>, as well as achieving ***(13/44) Sleepy Takuma: Don't kill anyone with Takuma during the mission “The Best Laid Plans”*** and ***(14/44) The Best Laid Plans: Finish the mission “The Best Laid Plans”***.
* Reload your manual save. Then, achieve ***(15/44) Knife in the Back: Kill the Captain*** by killing the Straw Hat on the bridge of the ship.
* Earn <u>(14/17) On Tree Island, kill all enemies except the Samurai with Takuma, without raising the alarm</u>. Note that you can use your other characters to knock our guards for Takuma to shoot. They can also hide bodies to prevent the alarm from being raised.

<p class="navigation-link">[Back to Navigation](#navigation)</p><br>




### Red Lights At Matsuyama
The second interlude mission. It has very few achievements and no badges.

<h4 class="normal-difficulty">Playthrough #1</h4>

* Achieve ***(16/44) Red Lights at Matsuyama: Finish the mission “Red Lights at Matsuyama”*** by finishing this playthrough.
* Achieve ***(17/44) The Lights Stay On: Don't extinguish any light sources in Matsuyama***. This is fairly straightforward; most guards aren't actually in sight of lamps anyway. It is unclear whether killing the guard carrying the torch near the entrance to the courtyard counts; to be on the safe side, you can ignore him. The level is still straightforward even with his presence.

<p class="navigation-link">[Back to Navigation](#navigation)</p><br>




### The Secrets of Hana Gakuen
The final story mission. This mission has a lot of achievements, and some of these too conflict with certain badges. Hence, manual saves will be used to play through the mission multiple times to achieve conflicting objectives with the minimum effort.

<h4 class="hard-difficulty">Playthrough #1</h4>

* Achieve ***(18/44) Clean Hands, Dirty Tricks: Kill 10 guards with traps in Hana Gakuen***. This is pretty easy to do; there are dozens of traps littered throughout the level. And you can always quicksave-quickload to get the final few.
* Achieve ***(19/44) Everyone Likes to Pet the Tanuki: Distract 4 guards at the same time with Kuma***. You can do this either at the stage or right outside the exit from the secret tunnel used at the start to enter the compound. For the latter, see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AxGC7w3iRj4).
* Achieve ***(20/44) Just Let Us In: Fail the Shrine riddle at the beginning 3 times***. The correct order is bird, cat, frog. Just don't do that thrice 😂
* Achieve ***(21/44) Good Old Rock... Nothing Beats That: Kill a samurai with a rock***. Mugen can do this with the Samurai guarding the theater's entrance with the rocks there.
* At some point, get all 5 characters into one bush to achieve ***(22/44) One Bush to Hide Them All: Hide with all characters in a single bush***.
* Now, proceed to the theatre *without picking up the disguise*. This is easier than it looks; just be patient in the immediate area before the stage entrance. Before you enter with Aiko, open the secret passageway there; this leads to the exit. Get all other characters to the exit point just beneath the waterfall. At this point, put down a **manual save**.
* From here, hide Aiko in the bushes just inside the theater entrance. From here, you can comfortably kill Lady Chiyo with Aiko's `Flintlock`. It doesn't matter if you set of an alert; the mission concludes the minute all five characters reach the waterfall's base.
* Upon killing Lady Chiyo in this manner, you will earn <u>(15/17) Don't kill anyone besides Lady Chiyo at the shrine or the theater</u> and <u>(16/17) Kill Lady Chiyo without using explosive powder of poison gas</u>. You will also achieve ***(23/44) Face to Face: Kill Lady Chiyo without getting a disguise***
* Now, complete the mission to earn <u>(17/17) Complete the mission on Hardcore difficulty</u> and achieve ***(24/44) The Secrets of Hana Gakuen: Finish “The Secrets of Hana Gakuen”***. By completing this badge, you will achieve ***(25/44) Badge Collector: Collect 17 badges***.
* At this point, you can reload your manual save. Put on Aiko's disguise, then use it to activate the **five** hidden passages around the map.
* At some point during this, use all 5 characters to knock or kill somebody. This will achieve ***(26/44) Five Shadows: Execute a plan with all 5 characters*** and ***(27/44) Planning Master: Kill or knock out 5 guards at the same time with all 5 characters***. 
* Finally, use Takuma to shoot Lady Chiyo from the specific location shown in [this video](https://youtu.be/7RSnhuVTPtw?t=240).
* Complete the mission to achieve ***(28/44) What's Done is Done: Kill Lady Chiyo with any character other than Aiko*** and ***(29/44) Tunnel Rat: Find all hidden caves in Hana Gakuen***.
* Note that you'll likely get additional badges during this mission, such as the one related to falling objects. The speedrun time is also very generous, so if you follow any mildly optimized route, you'll get it. If so, you will not need to complete missed badges in the previous missions.

### Aiko's Choice
The final interlude mission and the final mission of the game. This mission has a few achievements, and no badges.

<h4 class="normal-difficulty">Playthrough #1</h4>

* Achieve ***(30/44) Kuma's Story: Listen to everything Kuma has to say*** by repeatedly interacting with Kuma until the achievement pops up.
* Achieve ***(31/44) Aiko's Choice: Finish all missions*** by completing this playthrough.

<p class="navigation-link">[Back to Navigation](#navigation)</p><br>

* ***(41/44) Multiple Personalities: Use Aiko's disguise 15 times***: This can be done in *The Secrets of Hana Gakuen* after your first playthrough. Reload your manual save, get the disguise, and put it on and take it off in a loop until you get the achievement.
* ***(42/44) Little Giant: Kill 3 Samurai with Yuki***: This can be done in *The Best Laid Plans*. Reload your manual save, then use Yuki to repeatedly kill the Samurai on Tree Island until you get the achievement.

* ***(44/44) All Bad Things Come From Above: Kill 10 guards with a drop attack***

You'll likely have finished most, if not all, of these just by playing the game. I've however included tips for those which are the easiest to miss. And that's it! If you made it this far, congratulations! You should have a proud **44 of 44** on your Steam profile 😀
